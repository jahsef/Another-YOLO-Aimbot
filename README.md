YOLO Target Assistant (For Research & Educational Use Only)

Real-time object tracking with YOLOv11 + TensorRT, optimized for low-latency environments.


üìå Overview

This project demonstrates the use of real-time computer vision and deep learning techniques for automated target acquisition. It utilizes YOLOv11 for object detection, with a custom pipeline optimized for low-latency inference at 240+ FPS using TensorRT, CuPy, and Torch.


Requirements (Tested)

Python 3.11

CUDA 12.6

TensorRT 10.8

PyTorch 2.6.0+cu126

Betterercam (custom fork; can be adapted for Bettercam or DXCam, with some performance trade-offs)

üöÄ Performance

Tested at 320√ó320 resolution

200+ FPS on RTX 3070 in live environment

Lowering game settings recommended to maximize FPS

FPS may bottleneck at frame buffer limits during live use (monitor refresh rate)
